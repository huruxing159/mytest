This is the GloPort front-end system, designed to facilitate clients creating specifications sufficient to create sample products.  There is an extremely high order conversion rate for clients reaching the sample stage (>50%).

The front end is written in Ruby using Sinatra/Haml/Sass for the Web page display, and Sequel library for persistence.  It uses MySQL as the database engine.

To run a demonstration of this product:
1) Install needed gems; this includes ImageMagic that must be compiled.  For Snow Leopard OS X, 
    Google for the setup script to do that from GitHub.
2) Create a local database schema called china_b2b_development
3) Run the migration scripts from Rake, including creating sample data:
    rake db:rebuild
4) Start up Sinatra from the root of the project
    ruby server.rb
5) Web pages will be served at URL:
    http://localhost:4567
    
Good luck!
